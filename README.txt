Web based  3D Model Viewer

Description:
This web based 3D model viewer was designed to display models over the internet using THREE.js library. The problem this model viewer was solving is a way to display 3D models without taken and displaying multiple pictures. 

How to use: 
  -Left click to rotate around object 
  -Right click to move camera 
  -Mouse Wheel to zoom in and out
  -Use the GUI controls on the upper right hand corner to adjust settings and view in different ways. 

Notes: 

  -When installing on website server, unzip folders and keep them close to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This is so the model viewer can find the files. Example: 
		-cubeMaps
		-js
		-models
		-EX_02.html
		-EX_02CSS.css
		-EXJS.js

-Breadtruck Model tends to take longer to load, because of polycount or geometry.
